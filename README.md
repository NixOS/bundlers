# Nix Bundlers

Bundlers are a way to transform derivations. The most common and default
usage is based on the [original by
matthewbauer](https://github.com/matthewbauer/nix-bundle). Each bundler
is function over a value (usually a derivation) that produces another
derivation.

```console
$ nix bundle --bundler github:NixOS/bundlers nixpkgs#hello
```

to provided an opinionated and curated list.

TODO: bundlers should be also discoverable on search.nixos.org
